## DLNN For Contrail Avoidance Assessment (DCAA)

### Abstract

	This research endeavor is motivated by the growing concern regarding global warming. Contrail formation, especially the formation of cirrus clouds known as Ice Super Saturated Regions (ISSR), has been pinpointed as a contributing factor. These clouds possess the ability to reflect energy radiated from the Earth's surface, resulting in an elevation of surface temperatures. The aim of our project, therefore, is to forecast and identify contrails in the sky, harnessing the capabilities of machine learning algorithms. The significance of employing machine learning techniques cannot be overstated, as they play a pivotal role in the groundbreaking predictive methodology introduced in this project. A pioneering predictive approach utilized in this project encompasses the use of machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks. We utilized Roboflow for our Image Classification and training. In this process, we annotated the sky images and subsequently trained them using Roboflow's model. This model predicts the presence of contrails in the images based on the provided training and testing data. This ensures precise and efficient contrail detection, providing a deeper insight into their environmental implications. Ultimately, our project approach involves predicting contrail formation in the sky to detect ISSR and adjusting flight paths to avoid these regions.
